# Summary of how this was developed with claude

It started with an idea...use claude to generate some standard data about a server and let him review it.
Then when it started to get usefull, the idea was to write an article for howtoforge.com.  So I asked claude to help.

He review the articles and suggested how to formnat it.  It was usefull and simple, the kind of code I like.
But he did not follow the rules for hotforge and produced markdown format.  I submitted anyway. Never heard back, but that is ok.

I then kept adding on new small scripts. Each looking from a different viewpoint. The analysis got better. How do I know it got better...because I have been manually tightening web/mail/database servers for a long time in the wild.  And getting owned is nothing new.

I have decided to migrate early and often and devops as much as I can.  This is a good example of how.  This took about 40 hours to get to this point. The 4.0 Claude is a race horse.  You have to hole the reigns hard. He will take you on a ride.  My current way of working with him is reasonably solid.  I focus on "tell me what you want to code". I have a vision and we make it happen for one refernce part.  Adding new parts and keeping the many parts working together is the hard part. The human must find the path and keep the ai coder on that path.  good luck.

Now let me address this.  There is no way I would hook and AI into my IDE at this time. Copilot on VSCode is distracting for me in my "creative mode". I am about to uninstall it.
