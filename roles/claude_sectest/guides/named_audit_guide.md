# BIND/Named DNS Server Security Audit Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive security analysis criteria for BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) DNS servers, commonly referenced as `named`. It covers configuration security, performance optimization, and threat mitigation for both authoritative and recursive DNS services.

## Security Risk Classifications

### Critical Risks (Immediate Action Required)
- **Open Recursive DNS**: Public recursion enabling DDoS amplification attacks
- **Version Disclosure**: DNS server version exposed to attackers
- **Zone Transfer Vulnerabilities**: Unauthorized AXFR/IXFR access
- **Cache Poisoning Vectors**: Inadequate query randomization or validation
- **DNSSEC Validation Disabled**: Missing cryptographic DNS validation

### High Priority Issues
- **Unencrypted Zone Transfers**: AXFR/IXFR without TSIG authentication
- **Inadequate Access Controls**: Missing or weak IP-based restrictions
- **Response Rate Limiting Disabled**: No protection against DNS amplification
- **Logging Gaps**: Insufficient audit trails for security events
- **Resource Exhaustion**: No limits on concurrent queries or memory usage

### Medium Priority Concerns
- **Suboptimal Forwarders**: Using public DNS without redundancy
- **Missing Monitoring**: No active health checks or alerting
- **Configuration Complexity**: Overly complex or undocumented settings
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Inefficient caching or query processing

### Low Priority Optimizations
- **Default Settings**: Using BIND defaults instead of optimized values
- **Documentation**: Missing inline comments or external documentation
- **Monitoring Granularity**: Could benefit from more detailed metrics

## Configuration Security Analysis

### Core Security Settings

#### Recursive Query Control
**Secure Configuration:**
```
recursion no;                    # Disable for authoritative-only servers
allow-recursion { trusted; };    # Restrict recursive queries
allow-query-cache { trusted; };  # Control cache access
```

**Security Assessment:**
- **Authoritative servers** should have `recursion no`
- **Recursive servers** must restrict `allow-recursion` to trusted networks
- **Mixed-mode servers** require careful access control separation

#### Version and Information Disclosure
**Secure Configuration:**
```
version "DNS Server";            # Hide actual version
hostname none;                   # Don't reveal server hostname
server-id none;                  # Don't reveal server ID
```

**Security Assessment:**
- Version strings should never reveal BIND version or OS details
- Server identification should be generic or disabled
- Response should not leak internal network information

#### Zone Transfer Security
**Secure Configuration:**
```
allow-transfer { xfer-servers; };    # Restrict AXFR access
also-notify { slaves; };             # Controlled notifications
notify explicit;                     # Explicit notification control
```

**Security Assessment:**
- Zone transfers should be restricted to authorized secondary servers
- TSIG authentication should be used for all transfers
- Transfer logs should be monitored for unauthorized attempts

### Advanced Security Controls

#### Response Rate Limiting (RRL)
**Secure Configuration:**
```
rate-limit {
    responses-per-second 10;
    window 5;
    slip 2;
    exempt-clients { trusted; };
};
```

**Security Assessment:**
- RRL should be enabled to prevent DNS amplification attacks
- Rates should be tuned based on legitimate traffic patterns
- Trusted clients should be exempted from rate limiting

#### Query Processing Security
**Secure Configuration:**
```
resolver-query-timeout 10;           # Prevent hanging queries
max-cache-ttl 86400;                # Limit cache poisoning window
max-ncache-ttl 3600;                # Control negative caching
disable-empty-zone "10.in-addr.arpa.";  # Prevent RFC1918 leaks
```

**Security Assessment:**
- Query timeouts should prevent resource exhaustion
- TTL limits should balance performance and security
- Empty zones should prevent internal network disclosure

## DNSSEC Security Analysis

### DNSSEC Signing Assessment
**Configuration Elements:**
- **Signing policies**: Automated vs manual key management
- **Key rollover procedures**: ZSK and KSK rotation schedules
- **Algorithm selection**: Modern algorithms (ECDSA preferred)
- **Trust anchor management**: Proper DS record delegation

**Security Evaluation:**
- DNSSEC should be enabled for all authoritative zones
- Automated key management reduces operational risk
- Key sizes should meet current cryptographic standards
- Trust chain validation should be properly configured

### DNSSEC Validation (Recursive)
**Secure Configuration:**
```
dnssec-validation auto;              # Enable automatic validation
dnssec-lookaside auto;              # Use DLV if available
trust-anchors-file "managed-keys.bind";
```

**Security Assessment:**
- Validation should be enabled for all recursive queries
- Trust anchors should be automatically maintained
- Validation failures should be logged and monitored

## Performance and Resilience Analysis

### Resource Management
**Configuration Assessment:**
- **Memory limits**: Adequate cache sizes without exhaustion risk
- **File descriptor limits**: Sufficient for concurrent connections
- **Query limits**: Protection against resource exhaustion attacks
- **Worker threads**: Optimal performance without oversubscription

### Operational Resilience
**Infrastructure Elements:**
- **Redundancy**: Multiple servers with proper load distribution
- **Monitoring**: Active health checks and performance metrics
- **Backup procedures**: Configuration and zone data protection
- **Update procedures**: Secure and tested deployment processes

## ISPConfig Integration Security

### ISPConfig-Specific Considerations
**Configuration Elements:**
- **Zone management**: Automated zone generation and updates
- **Access controls**: Integration with ISPConfig user permissions
- **Logging integration**: Coordination with ISPConfig audit trails
- **Update mechanisms**: Secure API access and change management

**Security Assessment:**
- ISPConfig-generated zones should follow security best practices
- Zone updates should be authenticated and logged
- DNS service should be isolated from web/mail services
- Configuration changes should trigger security validation

## Common Attack Vectors and Mitigations

### DNS Amplification Attacks
**Detection Indicators:**
- High volume of queries from single source
- Queries for large record types (TXT, ANY)
- Response sizes significantly larger than queries

**Mitigation Assessment:**
- Response rate limiting properly configured
- Recursive services properly restricted
- Monitoring for amplification patterns
- Coordination with upstream providers for attack mitigation

### Cache Poisoning Attacks
**Vulnerability Indicators:**
- Predictable query IDs or source ports
- Insufficient query randomization
- Missing DNSSEC validation
- Weak entropy sources

**Security Validation:**
- Query ID randomization is functioning
- Source port randomization is enabled
- DNSSEC validation prevents spoofed responses
- Cache coherency is maintained

### Zone Enumeration Attacks
**Detection Indicators:**
- Systematic queries for non-existent records
- NSEC walking attempts
- Bulk zone transfer attempts

**Protection Assessment:**
- NSEC3 implementation prevents zone walking
- Zone transfer restrictions are enforced
- Rate limiting prevents enumeration
- Monitoring detects systematic probing

## Compliance and Best Practices
